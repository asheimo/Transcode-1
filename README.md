# Transcode Tools

GUI to remux and transcode videos based on the teachings and tools of [Don Melton](http://donmelton.com/)

## About

I hate having to do things in multiple tools and/or from the command line. That's just how I grew up, GUI all the way. So after spending
some time transcoding my own videos using both Don's [transcode-video](https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding) and [other-transcode](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding), and other tools such as [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/),
MKVToolnix, etc. I decided I wanted to roll my workflow into a one-stop shop. 

I'm not re-inventing the wheel, just taking tools that perform functions very well and putting a graphical face on them, so that to me,
they are easier to use and batch friendly at the same time.

## Installation

The application is portable so really the installation for it is simple. 
The applications depends on the following:
  ### For Primary functions
  ffmpeg
  ffprobe
  other-transcode
  
  ### For ancillary functions
  mpv
  subtitleedit

All of these should be made available through the system Path

## Usage
